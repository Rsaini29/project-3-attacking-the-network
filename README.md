# Attacking the Network

For our final project we worked to investigate & verify that the newly created alerts on our Kibana dashboard were functioning. If working, the engineers were to monitor live traffic to detect any abnormalities that were not observed in the alerting system. To set off these alerts, we exploited an unsecured Wordpress installation that was set up on a target virtual machine. Upon completion of our pen test, we created a separate slide presentation analyzing live traffic on our virtual network using Wireshark.
